## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

### Question 1
What is the Feynman Technique? Paraphrase the video in your own words.

Named after a Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, Feynman Technique is a learning technique that means to be able to explain complex subjects in simpler terms so that even a person who has no basic knowledge of that subject or even a child is able to understand it. It’s a simple principle that if you have a deep understanding of something you can explain it to anyone who has no idea what it is and how it works.

### Question 2
What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?

1. Write the name of the technique.
2. Explain the concept in simple language that can be understood by anyone.
3. Identify your weaknesses and work on them.
4. Break down the complicated terms and try to do it in simpler way.

### Question 3
Paraphrase the video **in detail** in your own words.

You might be spending hours and hours on learning something everyday and might feel stuck and frustrated. Learning something can be vastly improved by using proper techniques. Like how your brain has focused and diffused mode and it goes back and forth while you learn. You can use the ideas from diffused mode and bring them into focused mode. Also, practicing something over and over makes it easier to learn, just like how you would practice a song in order to learn it. Working constantly on something without taking a break is also a bad thing, the way to solve it is to allocate some time like 30 min and do it with complete focus and then relax for a couple of minutes and do what you enjoy. 

### Question 4
What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

1. When stuck, step away from the problem and relax a bit and try thinking from a different perspective.
2. Working constantly on something is not good, take a break and do something you enjoy in between.
3. If you want to get good at something just doing it once is not enough, practice it over and over and challenge yourself.

### Question 5
Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.

Learning something new can be very challenging at first, but we shouldn’t let that discourage us. We should keep working on it even if we feel stupid. To learn any new skill, we first should deconstruct it and set small goals and work towards it. Once you understand something you need to practice it and get good at it, if you don’t practice, even if you have a good understanding of something you won’t get good at it. Understanding what’s slowing you down and getting around it can be really helpful, if you remove your barriers you can learn something even faster.

### Question 6
What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

 1. Break apart the skill and set a goal and practice towards achieving it.
 2. Learn enough till you understand what you are doing and know when you are making a mistake.
 3. Remove barriers,
 4. Practice 20 hours at least.
